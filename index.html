									<h2><a href="https://github.com/nanamiih/Machine-Learning-in-Business-Kaggle-Restaurant-Revenue-Prediction">Machine Learning in Business | Kaggle Competition : Restaurant-Revenue-Prediction<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>With over 1,200 quick service restaurants across the globe, TFI is the company behind some of the world's most well-known brands: Burger King, Sbarro, Popeyes, Usta Donerci, and Arbyâ€™s. They employ over 20,000 people in Europe and Asia and make significant daily investments in developing new restaurant sites.

Right now, deciding when and where to open new restaurants is largely a subjective process based on the personal judgement and experience of development teams. This subjective data is difficult to accurately extrapolate across geographies and cultures.

New restaurant sites take large investments of time and capital to get up and running. When the wrong location for a restaurant brand is chosen, the site closes within 18 months and operating losses are incurred.

Finding a mathematical model to increase the effectiveness of investments in new restaurant sites would allow TFI to invest more in other important business areas, like sustainability, innovation, and training for new employees. Using demographic, real estate, and commercial data, this competition challenges you to predict the annual restaurant sales of 100,000 regional locations.</p>

										<h2><a href=""https://github.com/nanamiih/Machine-Learning-in-Business-Kaggle-Santander-Customer-Satisfaction">Machine Learning in Business | Kaggle Competition : Santander Customer Satisfaction<br />
									</a></h2>
									</header>
										<p>A recently concluded Kaggle competition had a prize of $60,000 and was about predicting customer satisfaction: Santander Customer Satisfaction From frontline support teams to C-suites, customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. Unhappy customers don't stick around. What's more, unhappy customers rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving.

Santander Bank is asking Kagglers to help them identify dissatisfied customers early in their relationship. Doing so would allow Santander to take proactive steps to improve a customer's happiness before it's too late.

In this competition, predict if a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking experience.</p>

										<p>Before asking someone on a date or skydiving, it's important to know your likelihood of success. The same goes for quoting home insurance prices to a potential customer. Homesite, a leading provider of homeowners insurance, does not currently have a dynamic conversion rate model that can give them confidence a quoted price will lead to a purchase.

Using an anonymized database of information on customer and sales activity, including property and coverage information, Homesite is challenging you to predict which customers will purchase a given quote. Accurately predicting conversion would help Homesite better understand the impact of proposed pricing changes and maintain an ideal portfolio of customer segments.</p>

										<p>In this project, I perform hyperparameter tuning of the two classifiers by changing at least three different hyperparameters for each classifier. By using random, grid and Bayes search for hyperparameter tuning along with cross-validation, and build three new models of each type (i.e., decision tree, random forest) based on the "best parameters" from each type of tuning.</p>
